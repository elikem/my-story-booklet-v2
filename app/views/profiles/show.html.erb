              I was thanking the van driver at the airport and as I tipped him I said I have this copy of my story of how I made the most important decision of my life when I came to know God personally. I showed him the booklet turned to the page with my story and asked him if he would like to have 
              the booklet. He said â€œyes and would there be any chance he could have a second booklet for his wife.</blockquote></p>
